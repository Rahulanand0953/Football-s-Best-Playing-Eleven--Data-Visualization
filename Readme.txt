Predicting World's Best Playing Eleven in Football and Visualizing the data.

Team formation is regarded as a high-level tactic in soccer. We know how important teamwork is for a game like football, but at the same time, we cannot ignore the performance of an individual player. It assigns players different responsibilities and indicates their active regions of play on the pitch, consequently enhancing team performance greatly. Detailed analysis of team formations in soccer has become particularly indispensable for soccer fans and analysts. So every player has a different responsibility, active position, etc. However, we aim to analyze each player based on their passing skills, sweeping skills, and a strong zone, so we can compare the players on similarities and find out the best player suitable for that particular position.In this study, we will closely work with domain experts to characterize domain problems of formation analysis in soccer and formulated several design goals. To consider the real structure of football, a play-by-play network analysis is needed that reflects actual interplay. Our major aim is to figure out the best playing 11 with the help of data visualization.
